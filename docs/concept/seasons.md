# Seasons

A calendar season cycle that gives the world a slow yearly rhythm. This is the
seasonal-forcing layer that [weather.md](weather.md) assumes ("driven by the
existing climate/season/day-night clock") and that
[ecosystem_dynamics.md](ecosystem_dynamics.md) flagged as its missing input:
phenology, growth, and (later) weather all read the current season instead of a
flat constant.

## Design pillars

1. **A real yearly rhythm, deterministic.** Season is a pure function of elapsed
   game-time — spring → summer → autumn → winter → spring — so the same moment
   always yields the same season and any two systems that read it agree.
2. **Modulates, doesn't gate.** Season shifts *rates* (how fast trees fruit, how
   vigorously plants grow) smoothly rather than switching things fully on/off, so
   transitions read as a gradual warming/cooling, not a hard flip. Real ecosystems
   respond to a continuous photoperiod/temperature curve, not a step change.
3. **One clock, many readers.** Fruiting, vegetation growth, weather, and survival
   exposure all read the one season value, the same way loaded and unloaded chunks
   share one population model — "two fidelities, one truth" applied to time.

## The season cycle

Elapsed game-time is divided into a year of four equal seasons. From it we derive:

- **Season** (`spring`/`summer`/`autumn`/`winter`) — the discrete label, for UI
  ("Spring · Rain") and any season-gated logic.
- **Warmth modifier** `[0,1]` — a smooth (cosine) curve peaking mid-summer and
  troughing mid-winter, standing in for the seasonal temperature/photoperiod
  swing. Multiplies the local climate warmth that drives fruit ripening
  (`FruitingModel` warmth): trees ripen and drop fruit fast in summer, slowly or
  not at all in deep winter — a compressed real bearing season.
- **Growth modifier** `[0,1]` — how vigorously vegetation grows this season
  (high in spring/summer, low in autumn/winter), for the vegetation/tall-grass
  layer to scale its growth rate later.

The year length is a tuned constant (compressed so a play session spans multiple
seasons), pinned by tests, not eyeballed.

## Status / mechanisms

- ✅ Season cycle model (season + warmth/growth modifiers) — `src/world/season_cycle.gd`, tested.
- ✅ Seasonal forcing of fruit phenology (season warmth scales `FruitingModel`) —
  wired in `EarthChunkManager._warmth_at_pixel`/`step_fruiting`.
- ✅ Season + current weather shown in the HUD (reuses the existing
  `weather_model.gd`; `EarthChunkManager.current_season`/`current_weather`,
  rendered in `World`'s debug readout as "Season · Weather").
- ⬜ Seasonal scaling of vegetation/tall-grass growth rate.
- ⬜ Seasonal crop viability for farming (see [farming.md](farming.md)).
- ⬜ Disaster events (drought/flood/wildfire) perturbing the season baseline
  (see [weather.md](weather.md)).
