## Weather & disasters

[world.md](world.md) already implies weather matters ("a drought or
overhunting measurably changes where you find [boars]") without ever
defining an actual system. This formalizes it: dynamic, simulated weather
that has real mechanical teeth, not just atmosphere.

- **Dynamic weather** (rain, storms, snow, fog) is driven by the existing
  climate/season/day-night clock ([world.md](world.md)) rather than being
  an independent random layer — a tropical biome and a tundra biome should
  weather differently by construction, RDR2/BOTW-style regional variety.
- **Occasional disaster events** — droughts, floods, wildfires, blizzards —
  are larger, rarer perturbations on top of normal weather that visibly
  stress [world.md](world.md)'s vegetation/population sim: a drought
  measurably drops carrying capacity in affected cells, a flood can
  reshape terrain temporarily, a wildfire (which can also be
  player-triggered — see below) clears vegetation and forces herbivore
  migration. For fruit/nut-bearing trees specifically, see
  [flora.md](flora.md#climate-and-water-abiotic-selection-alongside-animal-selection)
  — drought doesn't just lower density, it genetically selects for
  hardier trees, a good rain year triggers mast fruiting, and sustained
  climate trends make forests visibly migrate over time.
- **Mechanical, not just visual**, on two fronts:
  - **Survival** ([survival.md](survival.md)): exposure (cold/wet) feeds
    the same debuff-stacking model as hunger/exhaustion.
  - **Combat** ([combat.md](combat.md)): rain douses fire/oil effects,
    fog reduces line-of-sight independent of vegetation concealment, snow/
    mud could slow movement — weather becomes another environmental lever
    in the same family as knockback-into-hazards and spreadable fire.
- **Feeds [farming.md](farming.md)**: seasonal crop viability and
  disaster risk (a flood or drought threatening a farm plot) give farming
  actual stakes beyond a static grow-timer.

### Open questions

- Disaster frequency/scale — rare-and-memorable (a once-a-season regional
  event) vs. frequent-and-ambient; needs pacing design once other systems
  it stresses (farming, ecosystem) are further along.
- Do players get any warning/forecast, or is unpredictability part of the
  challenge (closer to real weather)?
- Can disasters ever be player-triggered deliberately (a Mage setting a
  controlled wildfire via [magic.md](magic.md)'s Ignite atom interacting
  with dry vegetation) as a tool, not just a threat?
